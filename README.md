The purpose of this project is to create a public web page where any Baltimore City resident can easily track the accomplishments of Mayor Scott's first term. Data will be compiled through the transition committees. More broadly, this is a tool any city government can use and adapt to share their progress achieving its commitments to residents on a set timeframe. We invite any local government to reach out to us if they're interested in producing similar public tools.
